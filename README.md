# COMPUTER ARCHITECUTE (FPGA project)
This project involves designing and implementing a computer architecture using FPGA technology. The goal is to create a functional and efficient architecture that can execute array multiplication a lot faster and far more effeciently than common CPUs. The project includes the following components:

- **Assets Management**: Implementing assets management aligning with limited components including cache, VRAM, LUTs ect.
- **I/O Interfaces**: Designing interfaces for input and output operations.
- **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**: Defining the algorithm that the processor will execute.
- **Simulation and Testing**: Using simulation tools to test and validate the architecture.
